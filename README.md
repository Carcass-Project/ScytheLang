# Scythe
Scythe is a systems programming language directed towards writing kernels and other low-level programs.

# Why did I make Scythe?
I felt bored, and I recently was using Rust and looking how to code an operating system using it.
I decided I'll make my own Rust and add in my own features.
It might not be the best idea but it's ok.

# Mockup

```
package -> "ExampleApp"
use package -> "io"

fn main() -> int
{
	var x <- "Hello, world!" : string
	print(x)
	return 1
}
```
